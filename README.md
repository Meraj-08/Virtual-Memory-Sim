### GDSC/Computer Science Educational Tool

## 📌 Overview  
Virtual Memory Manager is an interactive educational platform that visualizes memory management algorithms through simulations, comparisons, and quizzes. Designed to help students understand virtual memory concepts with hands-on experimentation.

## 🚀 Features  
- **Algorithm Simulations**: Interactive visualization of FIFO, LRU, Optimal, Clock, and other page replacement algorithms  
- **Performance Comparison**: Side-by-side metrics comparison across different algorithms  
- **Educational Resources**: Detailed explanations of memory management concepts  
- **Interactive Quiz**: Knowledge assessment with instant feedback  
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust frame counts, reference strings, and simulation speed  
- **Real-time Visualization**: Animated memory state changes during simulations  
- **TLB Simulation**: Optional Translation Lookaside Buffer implementation  

## 🏗️ Tech Stack  
- **Frontend**: Next.js, React  
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, ShadCN UI  
- **Visualization**: Recharts, SVG animations  
- **State Management**: React Context API  
- **Deployment**: Vercel  

## 📜 Problem Statement  
**Bridging the Gap in Memory Management Education**  
Computer science students often struggle to grasp virtual memory concepts through static diagrams. This tool provides dynamic, interactive visualizations to make these abstract concepts tangible and understandable.

## 🎯 Solution Approach  
- **Interactive Simulations**: Visualize algorithms in action with adjustable parameters  
- **Comparative Analysis**: Highlight performance differences between algorithms  
- **Gamified Learning**: Quiz system reinforces concepts through practice  
- **Responsive Design**: Accessible on all device sizes  

## 🔥 What Makes This Unique?  
✅ **Hands-on Learning** - Experiment with different algorithms in real-time  
✅ **Comprehensive Comparisons** - Visualize tradeoffs between approaches  
✅ **Academic Focus** - Designed specifically for computer science education  
✅ **Open Source** - Adaptable for different curricula and teaching styles
